The Password-Based Authentication System is a Python project designed to securely manage user login and registration using password protection. The main objective of this project is to implement a simple yet effective security mechanism where only authorized users can access the system.
In this project, users can create an account by providing a username and password, which is securely stored using hashing techniques. During login, the entered password is compared with the stored hashed password to validate the user. The system ensures that plain-text passwords are never stored, making the authentication process more secure.
The project also includes input validation, error handling, and a user-friendly command-line interface. It demonstrates fundamental Python concepts such as file handling, functions, loops, conditional statements, and the use of external libraries like hashlib for encryption. This makes the project ideal for beginners learning Python as well as those exploring basic cybersecurity principles.
